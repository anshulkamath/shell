# shell

Welcome to `anshulkamath`'s shell! Here, we will recreate a terminal shell in `C` using minimal dependencies (essentially limiting ourselves to `C`'s standard libraries). This will serve as a long-term project, and the goal is to implement as much functionality as possible from the original shell.

In order to complete this project, we will be including a checklist of items to recreate the Shell programming language. This checklist is shown below, and will be added to as the project progresses.

## checklist
- [ ] Regex
- [ ] Tokenizer
    - [ ] Create regex patterns for basic tokens/identifiers
    - [ ] Create enumerations for different classes of tokens
- [ ] Parser
    - [ ] Formulate a simple grammar for shell
- [ ] Evaluator
